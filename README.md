Though it has a very simple design, I could say that it is the best. I assured that the UI is responsive and very soothing in the eye as posible.
I also followed the Z Pattern for the weather widget, because users tends to scan from left to right.

## Code Implementation

As for the code implementation, it is the best because I wrote my server side codes by following the SOLID principle and writing it as clean and readable as possible.
